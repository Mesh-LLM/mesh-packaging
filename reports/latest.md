# CI timing history

1 recorded attempts. 1 separate job cohorts. 0 cohorts have a regression signal.

Signals require at least 5 known samples in each window and a 20% median increase. Queue and execution are evaluated separately. These are observations across different commits, not proof of a cause.

Runner provider and backend dimensions come from labels and job names. Unknown values remain null in JSON. Provider cohorts are never combined. No routing or provider settings are changed.

## Regression signals

| Repository / job | Provider | Metric | Baseline median | Recent median | Change | Samples |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

No supported regression signal. Cohorts with insufficient samples are still listed in reports/latest.json.

## Recent attempts

| Repository / workflow | Attempt | Result | Attempt elapsed | Job execution sum | Rerun delay | Observed run artifact bytes |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Mesh-LLM/mesh-packaging / Packaging Precheck | [34187922125/1](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-packaging/actions/runs/34187922125/attempts/1) | success | 135s | 133s | unknown | 0 |

Job execution sums include overlapping jobs and are not wall-clock durations. Artifact bytes preserve unique IDs ever observed for the whole run, including artifacts no longer listed by GitHub, and must not be summed across rerun attempts. Reused successful jobs are excluded from rerun execution. Attempt elapsed includes queueing and gaps between jobs.

## Recent failures and cancellations

No non-success attempts in the recorded history.
